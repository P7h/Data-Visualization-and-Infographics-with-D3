# data-journalism-d3

These code examples accompany the course “Data Visualization and Infographics with D3,” taught by [Alberto Cairo](http://thefunctionalart.com/) and [Scott Murray](http://alignedleft.com/), and offered through the [Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas](http://open.journalismcourses.org) at UT Austin.

Examples are grouped by module, with each folder corresponding to a different module of the course.

Some of these examples are adapted from code files for *Interactive Data Visualization for the Web* (O’Reilly, March 2013).
